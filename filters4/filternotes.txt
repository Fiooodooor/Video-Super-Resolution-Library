1. Filters trained on 675 images of pexels with area & bicubic & lancoz & nearest & blur degradation
2. Angle=24 Strength=3 Coherence=3 setting for both filters
3. Cheapupscale: using output with bilinear upscaling for 1st pass, No cheapupscale of 2nd pass training.
4.  10bit 1pass filter trained with multi-lr: bicubic+area+nearest+lanczos as LR and HRSharpen50 as HR
    10bit 2pass filter trained with  HR after single augment:blur as cheapupscale images and sharpened HR images as HR
    8bit 1pass filter trained with multi-lr: bicubic+area+nearest+lanczos as LR and HRSharpen50 as HR
    8bit 2pass filter is the same with the filter4-2pass filter of the past version.
