Filter for 2 pass for denoise and 2x upscale
1. Filters trained on ~700 images of pexels with linear degradation
2. Angle=24 Strength=3 Coherence=3 setting for both filters
3. The 1st is a denoiser and the 2d pass an upscaler with some sharpness added (same as filters4 1st pass)
4. Need to run this filter with passes=2 and mode=2
