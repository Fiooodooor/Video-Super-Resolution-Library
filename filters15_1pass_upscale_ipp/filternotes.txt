Filter for 1 pass for 1.5x upscale
1. Filters trained on ~700 images of pexels with linear degradation
2. Angle=24 Strength=3 Coherence=3 setting for both filters
3. The 1st is an upscaler with some sharpness added with cheapupscaled generated with linear upscaler.
4. Need to run this filter with passes=2 and mode=2
